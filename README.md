# mkproject
Create Project workspace structure(directory structure) based on the type of the project.

## Problem Statement
I usually work on projects that spans an entire spectrum of programming languages. Each of these projects have different configurations and build scripts that are implemented. Copying the respective
files and creating the directories manually was cumbersome and hence I came up with this idea wherein once the program is invoked, the program - based on certain configuration, will be copying the
files as well as creating the necessary directories.

## Working Principle
