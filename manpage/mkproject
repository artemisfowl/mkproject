.SH NAME
mkproject \- create a project structure based on the template specified
.SH SYNOPSIS
mkproject [-t[JSON template filename]] [project_directory_name/location]
.SH DESCRIPTION
mkproject is a shell program made to reduce the time taken to create the base
project structure using a template specified by the user.
For example, if the user wishes to create a C-lang type project and wants to
create certain specified directories to be held inside the project along with
certain build related files, the following command should do so provided rest
of the configurations have been done properly.

$ mkproject -t <json_template_name> <path_where_project_has_to_be_created>
.PP
$ mkproject -t c ~/data/code/commit/github/c_project
.PP
This program can be setup in the following way:
.PP
Initially this program keeps a configuration file in the user $HOME/.config
directory. This configuration file(called mkpconfig) can be found under
mkproject directory inside $HOME/.config. The file contains only one single
entry, an absolute path to the location where the template directories will be
kept.
.PP
When the program is run for the first time, it will check if these directories
are present or not and if not, create them. It will also check if the mkpconfig
file is present or not and if not it will create an empty file with a dummy
path to the /res/ directory.
.PP
The /res/ directory is the one which will be housing the project JSON templates
as well as the build files which need to be copied.
